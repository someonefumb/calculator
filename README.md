# Calculator
A calculator that has the basic math operations (+, -, *, /), along with other features.

## Reflection
This thing was really hard to code. There were so many intertwining things that caused a lot of bugs and frustration. The most difficult aspect of this project was the outputs of everything. 

I wanted the calculator to work exactly like the Windows calculator like if you pressed + and then =, it would add itself on top of each other. After messing with different things, my calculator is some what like that and I don't want to spend anymore time on this, so if there any bugs, it's a feature (just use the clear button).
